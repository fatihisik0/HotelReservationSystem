# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System 

A robust and modern **Windows Forms Application** developed in C# to manage hotel rooms, customers, and reservations.
This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as Classes, Encapsulation, and Collections.

##  Features 

* **Room Management:** Add new rooms with specific numbers and prices. Prevents duplicate room numbers.
* **Customer Management:** Register guests with their names and contact details.
* **Reservation System:** Create bookings with Check-in/Check-out dates.
* **Availability Check:** Smart algorithm to check if a room is available for selected dates (prevents double booking).
* **Conflict Detection:** Automatically alerts if dates overlap with an existing reservation.
* **Modern UI:** User-friendly interface with grouped sections and color-coded indicators.
* 
##  Technologies Used 

* **Language:** C#
* **Framework:** .NET Framework (Windows Forms)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
* **Concepts:** OOP, Collections (List<T>), Exception Handling (Try-Catch), Event-Driven Programming.

2.  **Add Customer:** Enter guest details.
3.  **Check Availability:** Select dates and a room, then click "Check Availability" to see if it's free.
